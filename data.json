The main purpose for making a student to learn his or her favorite subject as a open elective is to make a student to learn some more new skills and different skills other then his or her main course subject. Here at PES we believe that having a extra skill is always beneficial for a student. A student can select any subject related to sports, engineering, law, entrepreneurship, etc. It does not matter that a student has his or her major subject related to it or not and if he or she knows anything about this subject or not. This is a three years course where a student will get a deep knowledge about his or her choosen subject and he or she will also get a minor degree which denotes that the student has sucessfully completed his course related to open elective and he or she has a deep knowledge about that subject.
